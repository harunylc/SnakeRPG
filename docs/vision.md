# Snake Survivor Vision

**Concept**: Top-down bullet-hell survival where your "Snake" body is a growing arsenal of auto-firing weapons.

**Core Rules**:
- **Survival**: Start as a single Head with weak auto-fire. Enemies spawn endlessly from edges.
- **Movement**: You steer the head; the body follows. Positioning is your only defense.
- **Auto-Combat**: All units attack automatically. No active abilities.

**Progression Loop**:
1. **Kill & Collect**: Defeat enemies, gather XP gems.
2. **Level Up**: Game pauses. Choose an upgrade.
3. **Drafting**:
    - **New Unit**: Append a class segment (Archer, Mage, Shield) to the tail.
    - **Upgrade**: Buff an existing segment's stats.

**Constraints**: Pure mechanics. No story, no puzzles, no dungeon crawling. Just survive.
